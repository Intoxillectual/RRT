# RRT

This repo is about implementing Vanilla RRT algorithm. Repo consists of two versions for the implemenatation.

## RRT_Version 1
Version 1 is RRT implementation without obstacles. 

## RRT_Version 2
Version 2 is RRT implementation with obstacles(considering obstacle is a line segment).

## Instruction to get started
This code is compiled on C++ 14.

The output requires some inputs:
1. Enter starting co-ordinates
2. Enter goal co-ordinates
3. Enter number of RRT iterations 
4. Enter number of obstacles (Not included in version 1)
5. Enter co-ordinates of line segment (Not included in version 1)

Final answer will either be when the goal is reached or RRT iterations will be completed and co-ordinates through which it traversed will be displayed.
